# Background-free faces dataset for Image Generation

### I. Image source 

The code showcased here shows how to remove the background from all pictures in the FFHQ dataset.
However, the exact same code can be used to remove backgrounds from any face/person-based dataset, with minor tweaks.

### II. Method

Direct implementation of the [Object Detection tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html) by Pytorch.
Trained weigths are too large for GitHub but the training method and data is included in the code.

### III. Results
